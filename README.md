# Next.js example with Mantine and @next/font

This is an app that shows a way of using @next/font together with Mantine themes, this is also applicable where you need to set a font-family generated by the @next/font.

## How it was done

We load the font through @next/font/local for local files, or @next/font/google for google fonts.

Beyond inserting the font faces in your website, the @next/font also returns a object with a class name and the font-family of the font loaded, so we use this return inside the typography file to set the font family of the Mantine theme with the auto generated name by next.

## Running locally

If you want to test it out, just run 
``` 
yarn
yarn dev 
```
and you will see something like this in your localhost:3000

## Themes

There's two examples divided in the two themes, you can alternate between them in the _app.tsx file

### Local theme

Uses local files to load fonts, ideal for custom fonts that doesn't exists in google fonts

### Google font theme

Uses @next/font/google to load fonts
